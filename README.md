Design and implementation a simulation application aiming to analyze queuing based systems for determining and minimizing clientsâ€™ waiting time.
The application should simulate a series of clients arriving for service, entering queues, waiting, being served and finally leaving the queue.The management of queue based
systems is interested in minimizing the time amount their "clients" are waiting in queues before they are served.
